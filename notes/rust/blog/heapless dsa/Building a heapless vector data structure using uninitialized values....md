**Title:** Building a heapless vector data structure using uninitialized values with `MaybeUninit<T>` instead of using default values with `Option<T>`. Creating safe abstractions over unsafe code with safe APIs.

In this article, I'll teach you how to build a heapless vector data structure with the example of one I already built. I'll share the performance benefits and unsafety to look out for and avoid when using `MaybeUninit<T>` over `Option<T>`. Lastly, I'll show you how to build safe APIs on top of unsafe Rust code to ensure "safe unsafe code" in Rust.

A little primer before we begin on Rust memory models. Though, to fully comprehend this article you might need to have a practical understanding of Rust memory models--what's stored where, how, and what for--here's a little primer incase you're new to this.

Rust models memory in three main spaces/regions; the *stack*, the *heap*, and *static memory*.

The *stack* is a short-lived, fixed-size memory region with LIFO movement (Last In First Out). The stack stores data of local variables, primitive types, function parameters, and fixed-size collections like an array. When a function is called a contiguous chunk of memory is allocated to the top of the stack known as a *frame*.

The *heap* is a dynamic, growable region of contiguous memory. Collections and data in the heap does not have to be fixed-size, the size-bound is unneeded as the data can grow to fit runnable requirements. The heap isn't tied to the current call stack (i.e. `main` function stack frame) of the program. Data in the heap can live forever until it is explicitly deallocated.

*Static memory* is really a catch-all term for several closely related regions located in the file your program is compiled into. These regions are automatically loaded into your program's memory when that program is executed. Values in static memory live for the entire execution of your program (as described by Jon Gjengset in Rust for Rustaceans). Static memory stores source code, `'static` values, and values in `static` variables. Static memory is read-only by default, therefore immutable. Mutating data in static memory is unsafe (e.g. mutating static variables using `static mut`).

How does data behave in these different memory regions? We've already seen some examples in the paragraph on *the heap*, discussing further:
- Data in the stack is allocated/deallocated automatically (LIFO order) when entering/exiting scopes (i.e. function stack frames). Access is very fast. Size must be known at compile time. No manual management of stack data in Rust (*this is what we'll be building here using the vector type as an example*).
	- Example: `let x: i32 = 42;` – `x` lives on the stack during its scope.
- Data in the heap is allocated at runtime. Generally slower than the stack due to pointer indirection and potential fragmentation. Is managed using smart pointers (e.g. `Box<T>`, `Rc<T>`) with Rust's ownership system ensuring safety.
	- Example: `let v = vec![1, 2, 3];` – the vector's buffer is on the heap.
- Data in static memory is allocated at compile time into the program's binary with a fixed memory address. Immutable by default, as we talked about, and mutable with unsafe code. The data's lifetime starts when the program starts and ends when the program ends.
	- Example: `static HELLO: &str = "Hello";` – `HELLO` is stored statically and accessible anywhere.

Hope you enjoyed that primer because now we move onto answering the question: why would we need a heapless vector data structure in the first place?

There's a practice in Rust known as "Rust without the standard library" communicated in code with the crate attribute `#![no_std]`. To answer our earlier question, we need to understand this practice. 

Usually when you write, build and run Rust code, you most likely do it on a platform with an operating system and a sizeable amount of both RAM memory and disk space (i.e. your laptop or remote server). And sometimes, you write Rust code that is to be executed in environments without an operating system and with limited memory and storage size. This is usually the case when you build for embedded systems, where the code is closer to the bare metal (metaphorically to mean a microcontroller or a SoC). Furthermore, in these "unorthodox" environments, such as those without an operating system, or those without the ability to dynamically allocate memory; how does Rust, as a low level systems programming language, enable us build software that runs in these environments? Through the "Rust with the standard library" (`#![no_std]`) practice. Let's elaborate further on how it works.
