## Things to do to land a Rust role
1. know your craft
	1. this means knowing the fundamentals of rust (Ownership, Borrowing, Error Handling, Project Structure)
	2. also means knowing some of the advanced features like async Rust, macros and so on
	3. know how to write rust code in an idiomatic way, because you're gonna be working in a collaborative team of Rust developers
2. have the experience and confidence to build production grade Rust software
	1. building a complete piece of software you deploy somewhere and other people use is completely different from following tutorials or doing online exercises
	2. there are two benefits to having this experience:
		1. you'll feel comfortable and confident in interviews,
		2. more importantly, you'll have something to put on your resume to get the interview in the first place
3. have the right connections
	1. have a community of experts and enthusiasts who can help you along your learning journey,
	2. having access to rust recruiters who can advocate for you and help you land a rust role,
	3. and knowing developers who already have rust roles who can give you referrals
## Where to start learning Rust

> Starting from the groundup use [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) provided by The Rust Foundation.

> Moving to [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings): small exercises to get used to reading and writing Rust code.

> Then, [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/). RBE is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate various Rust concepts and standard libraries.

> You may also check out [Rust Adventure](https://www.rustadventure.dev/) if you'd fancy a paid subscription of $30/month for a more researched and structured Rust learning track.
