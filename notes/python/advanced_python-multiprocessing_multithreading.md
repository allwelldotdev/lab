## What is Multiprocessing?
- Multiprocessing is a technique that allows a program to run multiple tasks simultaneously.
- Each task is executed in its own process, which is a separate instance of the program.
- Multiprocessing takes advantage of multicore operating system architectures, in which multiple cores communicate directly through shared hardware caches.
- most useful for tasks that are CPU-bound.

## What is Multithreading?
- Multithreading is a technique that allows a program to run multiple tasks concurrently within a single process.
- Each task is executed in its own thread, which is a lightweight unit of execution that shares the same memory space as other threads in the process.
- Multithreading is useful for tasks that are I/O bound.
- 

> In Python, a major characteristic is its Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) which allows only one thread to hold control of the Python interpreter at once â€” preventing multiple threads from executing in parallel.
