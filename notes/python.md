## Virtual Environments
Virtual Environments in Python are used to make a copy of Python installation to enable you switch between Python versions and Python dependency versions or differences for your Python project.

Within Python virtual environments (or venv) are scripts to "activate" / "deactivate" the environment.

### Creating virtual environments
```bash
<python version/path> -m venv <your_env_name>
```

For example, if using python3.9 and you'd like to name your virtual environment 'py39_course':
```bash
python3.9 -m venv py39_course
```

> If using zsh on wsl:ubuntu, and you encounter a problem of not seeing the indication of the activated virtual environment via the name next to your user prompt in your terminal (as shown in the image below). Do the following:
