# A way to categorize git commits

Found this tip from looking at [Jeffrey's'](https://github.com/jeffreytse/zsh-vi-mode) `zsh-vi-mode` git commits.

- `docs`: for documentation
- `fix`: fixing errors
- `chore`: adding more uncategorized code
- `perf`: optimizing code performance
- `release`: for releases/tags
- `feat`: for app features
